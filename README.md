## Routes

### User Stories and related routes
#### I want to draw three cards
Draw three major arcana cards and assemble into a deck
1. /draw - 'GET' three cards at random from the deck
2. /deck - 'POST' post the deck of three cards to the user's account
  1. To 'post' to deck, user must sign in

#### I want to see my previous decks
See deck history, click a deck to see more details
1.  /deck - 'GET' get previous deck histories
1.  /deck/:id - 'GET' see details in one deck history

#### I want to note whether or not my reading was accurate
Update deck history to indicate reading's accuracy
1. /deck/:id - 'PATCH' update the deck's accuracy score

#### I want to delete previous readings
1. /deck/:id - 'DELETE' delete a particular deck


### Setup Environment:
1.  Install dependencies with `bundle install`.
1.  `git add` and `git commit` your changes.
1.  Create a `.env` for sensitive settings (`touch .env`).
1.  Generate new `development` and `test` secrets (`bundle exec rails secret`).
1.  Store them in `.env` with keys `SECRET_KEY_BASE_<DEVELOPMENT|TEST>`
    respectively.
1.  In order to make requests to your deployed API, you will need to set
    `SECRET_KEY_BASE` in the environment of the production API (for example, using `heroku config:set` or the Heroku dashboard).
1.  In order to make requests from your deployed client application, you will
    need to set `CLIENT_ORIGIN` in the environment of the production API (for example, `heroku config:set CLIENT_ORIGIN=https://<github-username>.github.io`).
    See more about deploying to heroku [rails-heroku-setup-guide](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/rails-heroku-setup-guide)

### Setup your database:
    - bin/rails db:drop (if it already exists)
    - bin/rails db:create
    - bin/rails db:migrate
    - bin/rails db:seed
    - bin/rails db:examples

  Note: Remember to follow the same commands when setting up your deployed database!

### Run your server!
1. Run the API server with `bin/rails server` or `bundle exec rails server`.

## Structure

This template follows the standard project structure in Rails.

`curl` command scripts are stored in [`curl-scripts`](curl-scripts) with names that
correspond to API actions.

User authentication is built-in.

## Tasks

Developers should run these often!

-   `bin/rails routes` lists the endpoints available in your API.
-   `bin/rspec spec` runs automated tests.
-   `bin/rails console` opens a REPL that pre-loads the API.
-   `bin/rails db` opens your database client and loads the correct database.
-   `bin/rails server` starts the API.
-   `curl-scripts/*.sh` run various `curl` commands to test the API. See below.

## API

Use this as the basis for your own API documentation. Add a new third-level
heading for your custom entities, and follow the pattern provided for the
built-in user authentication documentation.

Scripts are included in [`curl-scripts`](curl-scripts) to test built-in actions. Add your
own scripts to test your custom API. As an alternative, you can write automated
tests in RSpec to test your API.

### Reset Database without dropping

This is not a task developers should run often, but it is sometimes necessary.

**locally**

```sh
bin/rails db:migrate VERSION=0
bin/rails db:migrate db:seed db:examples
```

**heroku**

```sh
heroku run rails db:migrate VERSION=0
heroku run rails db:migrate db:seed db:examples
```
