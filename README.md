# In the cards - API

This is the back-end API for In the cards - a simple major arcana tarot card
reader. Please see the front end repository [here](https://github.com/TaraYoo/in-the-cards-client)
The front end is deployed [here](https://tarayoo.github.io/in-the-cards-client/#/)

## Dependencies (technologies used)

Install with `bundle install`.

-   [`rails-api`](https://github.com/rails-api/rails-api)
-   [`rails`](https://github.com/rails/rails)
-   [`active_model_serializers`](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers)
-   [`ruby`](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
-   [`postgres`](http://www.postgresql.org)


## Planning
### ERD
![ERD](./erd.png)

### Routes

#### User Stories and related routes
##### I want to draw three cards
Draw three major arcana cards and assemble into a deck
1. /draw - 'GET' three cards at random from the deck
2. /deck - 'POST' post the deck of three cards to the user's account
  1. To 'post' to deck, user must sign in

##### I want to see my previous decks
See deck history, click a deck to see more details
1.  /deck - 'GET' get previous deck histories
1.  /deck/:id - 'GET' see details in one deck history

##### I want to note whether or not my reading was accurate
Update deck history to indicate reading's accuracy
1. /deck/:id - 'PATCH' update the deck's accuracy score

##### I want to delete previous readings
1. /deck/:id - 'DELETE' delete a particular deck


### Setup Environment:
1.  Install dependencies with `bundle install`.
1.  `git add` and `git commit` your changes.
1.  Create a `.env` for sensitive settings (`touch .env`).
1.  Generate new `development` and `test` secrets (`bundle exec rails secret`).
1.  Store them in `.env` with keys `SECRET_KEY_BASE_<DEVELOPMENT|TEST>`
    respectively.
1.  In order to make requests to your deployed API, you will need to set
    `SECRET_KEY_BASE` in the environment of the production API (for example, using `heroku config:set` or the Heroku dashboard).
1.  In order to make requests from your deployed client application, you will
    need to set `CLIENT_ORIGIN` in the environment of the production API (for example, `heroku config:set CLIENT_ORIGIN=https://<github-username>.github.io`).
    See more about deploying to heroku [rails-heroku-setup-guide](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/rails-heroku-setup-guide)

### Setup your database:
    - bin/rails db:drop (if it already exists)
    - bin/rails db:create
    - bin/rails db:migrate
    - bin/rails db:seed
    - bin/rails db:examples

  Note: Remember to follow the same commands when setting up your deployed database!

### Run your server!
1. Run the API server with `bin/rails server` or `bundle exec rails server`.

## Structure

This template follows the standard project structure in Rails.

`curl` command scripts are stored in [`curl-scripts`](curl-scripts) with names that
correspond to API actions.

User authentication was built-in by Boston General Assembly.

## Tasks

-   `bin/rails routes` lists the endpoints available in your API.
-   `bin/rspec spec` runs automated tests.
-   `bin/rails console` opens a REPL that pre-loads the API.
-   `bin/rails db` opens your database client and loads the correct database.
-   `bin/rails server` starts the API.
-   `curl-scripts/*.sh` run various `curl` commands to test the API. See below.

## Future to-dos
- Add minor arcana cards to the deck
- Trim down unused assets and routes
- Add AWS upload routes

### Reset Database without dropping

This is not a task developers should run often, but it is sometimes necessary.

**locally**

```sh
bin/rails db:migrate VERSION=0
bin/rails db:migrate db:seed db:examples
```

**heroku**

```sh
heroku run rails db:migrate VERSION=0
heroku run rails db:migrate db:seed db:examples
```
